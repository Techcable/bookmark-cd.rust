# Homebrew Installation

`bcd` is not currently in the [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) core repository yet, however you can easily add a tap for `bcd` first:

``` sh
brew tap a1ecbr0wn/bcd
```

then run the install:

``` sh
brew install bcd
```

and then restart your shell.

If you are using a shell other than `bash`, you will need to run the following command to ensure correct [environment setup](install-issues-environment.md):

``` sh
bookmark-cd -i
```
